# Customer_Churn_Rate_Prediction_of_Expresso

# Project Overview

# Introduction
The telecommunications industry has undergone transformative evolution, with mobile network providers striving to deliver seamless connectivity and personalized services to an ever-growing customer base. Expresso, an African telecommunications company primarily operating in Maurita- nia and Senegal, faces challenges in managing customer retention while enhancing user satisfaction. In an era where churn—the loss of customers to competitors—can significantly impact revenue, un- derstanding the drivers behind customer loyalty has become paramount.

# Motivation
Expresso faces challenges with customer churn, a critical issue in the competitive telecommunica- tions sector. Predicting and addressing churn enables Expresso to proactively retain customers, enhance customer relationships, and maintain revenue stability. By leveraging machine learning to predict churn, Expresso can improve operational eﬀiciency, p rovide p ersonalized c ustomer in- terventions, and establish itself as a data-driven organization for long-term success. This not only empowers Expresso Telecom to implement targeted retention strategies but also contributes to building a stronger, more loyal customer base in a competitive market.

# Problem Definition
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning framework for predicting customer churn within Expresso’s user base. By analyzing key customer metrics such as data volume, recharge frequency, and regional segmentation, we aim to identify patterns and factors contributing to churn. The project involves building, tuning, and evaluating multiple classification m odels, i ncluding Lo- gistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines, to determine the most effective p redictive model.
